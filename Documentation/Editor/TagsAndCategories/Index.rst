===================
Tags and Categories
===================

Tag
===

Add one or multiple tags to the product. By default the tag will simply be
rendered in the detail view. Page with a page search (e.g. solr) could use tags
as filter.

Categories
==========

Add one or more categories to a product.

Within a category it is possible to define the list view PID and detail view PID
for products which have this category.
Furthermore it is possible to define one or more categories in the list view
plugin of EXT:cart so that only products with this/these categories are shown.
