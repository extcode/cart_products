===================
Tags and Categories
===================

Tag
===

Add one or multiple tags to the product. By default the tag will simply be
rendered in the detail view. Page with a page search (e.g. solr) could use tags
as filter.

Main Category
=============

Within a category it is possible to define the list view PID and detail view PID
for products which have this category.
This is the category which determines which page the product uses as detail view
if the teaser plugin is set and when the detail view PID was set within the
category.

Furthermore it is possible to define one or more categories in the list view
plugin of EXT:cart_products so that only products with this/these categories are
shown.

Associated Categories
=====================

This field can be used if a product shall be shown in multiple list view.
