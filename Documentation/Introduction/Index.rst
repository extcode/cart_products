Introduction
============

EXT:cart_products needs to be used together with EXT:cart. EXT:cart itself is
only the base for a webshop. Only using EXT:cart does not allow to sell anything
because there are no products. Therefore EXT:cart needs other extensions. One of
those other extensions is EXT:cart_products.

* It provides products which can be created in the TYPO3 backend.
* The data for those products are stored in own data tables.
* The data fields of the products fit many use cases for "usual products"
  (no books, no events).
* The products can be displayed on the website with a list view and a detail
  view.
* As it extends EXT:cart are the products compatible with EXT:cart and can
  therefore be be purchased with the cart functionality of EXT:cart.
