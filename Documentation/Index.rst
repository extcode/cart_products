Cart Products needs to be used together with EXT:cart. EXT:cart itself is only
the base for a webshop. EXT:cart_products provides products which can be created
in the TYPO3 backend. Those products fit many use cases for "usual products"
(no books, no events). The products can be displayed on the website with a list
view and a detail view. As said does it extend EXT:cart so those products can
be purchased with the cart of EXT:cart.
