Cart Products needs to be used together with EXT:cart.

* EXT:cart itself is only the base for a webshop.
* EXT:cart_products provides products which can be created in the TYPO3 backend.

  * Those products fit many use cases for "usual products" (no books, no events).
  * The products can be displayed on the website with a list view and a detail view.
  * As said does it extend EXT:cart so those products can be purchased with the cart of EXT:cart.
