========================================================
Important: #46 - Exclude Stock Handling from Translation
========================================================

See `Issue 46 <https://github.com/extcode/cart_products/issues/46>`__

Description
===========

For each product you can activate the stock management in the backend. Up to now, stock management was carried out
independently for each language.
The online shops implemented with the extension sell products with translated product titles and descriptions, but
not translated products.
Therefore there should be a collective stock for all translations of a product.

.. IMPORTANT::
   Check your database for differences in translated products.
   If any query shows a result, please take a closer look at the products
   or its backend variants and update them.
   If you are sure, the respective update query can also be used to adapt
   the data of the translations to the original language. For different
   stock levels in the products or their backend variants, this should be
   compared with the actual stock level.

      WHERE orig.stock IS NOT NULL AND orig.stock <> trans.stock

   Saving the products in the backend should update the field as well.

.. NOTE::

   If you require the old language-specific stock management, this version **must not** be installed.
   Please contact me in this case, so that an appropriate solution can be developed.
