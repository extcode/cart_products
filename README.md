Cart is a small but powerful extension which "solely" adds a shopping cart to your TYPO3 installation.
Cart Products provides an own data storage for simple and configurable products. Products can be offered via a list and detail view and can be purchased via cart function of the Cart extension.

- **minor updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller tasks without breaking changes.
